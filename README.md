# Assembly Language Programs for COA

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Assembly-blue.svg)

## Description

This repository is a collection of assembly language programs written for educational purposes, focusing on the fundamental concepts of **Computer Organization and Architecture (COA)**.

These programs are written for the **MIPS** architecture and are designed to be run on the **QtSpim** simulator to demonstrate various computational and logical operations at a low level.

## Software Requirement

To run these programs, you will need the **QtSpim** simulator. You can download it from its [official SourceForge repository](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/).

## How to Run

1.  **Open QtSpim:** Launch the `QtSpim` application.
2.  **Load File:** Go to `File` > `Load File` (or `Reinitialize and Load File`) and select one of the `.asm` files from this repository (e.g., `add_sum.asm`).
3.  **Run:** Press the `Run` button (often a green play icon) or press `F5` to execute the program.
4.  **View Output:** The program's output will appear in the `Console` window. You can also monitor the state of the registers and memory in the main QtSpim window.

## Program List

This repository contains the following programs:
